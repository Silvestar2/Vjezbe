    <h1>AI Sophia</h1>
    <img src="sophia-robot.webp">
    <p>Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by the Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics.[1] Sophia was activated on February 14, 2016,[2] and made her first public appearance in mid-March 2016 at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas, United States.[3]
       Sophia has been covered by media around the globe, and has participated in many high-profile interviews. In October 2017, Sophia was given Saudi Arabian citizenship, and became the first robot to receive citizenship of any country.[4][5] In November 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first Innovation Champion, and is the first non-human to be given a United Nations title.[6] </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
<p>Sophia was first activated on February 14, 2016.[7][8] The robot, modeled after the ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti,[9] Audrey Hepburn, and its inventor's wife, Amanda Hanson,[1][10] is known for its human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants. As of 2018, Sophia's architecture includes scripting software, a chat system, and OpenCog, an AI system designed for general reasoning.[11] Sophia imitates human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics (e.g. on the weather).[12] Sophia uses speech recognition technology from Alphabet Inc. (the parent company of Google) and is "designed to get smarter over time".[citation needed] Its speech synthesis ability is provided by CereProc's text-to-speech engine, and also allows it to sing. Sophia's intelligence software is designed by Hanson Robotics.[13][14] The AI program analyses conversations and extracts data that allows it to improve responses in the future.[15]

    Hanson designed Sophia to be a suitable companion for the elderly at nursing homes, or to help crowds at large events or parks. He has said that he hopes that the robot can ultimately interact with other humans sufficiently to gain social skills.[4] Sophia is marketed as a "social robot" that can mimic social behavior and induce feelings of love in humans.[1][16]
    
    Sophia has at least nine robot humanoid "siblings" who were also created by Hanson Robotics.[17] Fellow Hanson robots are Alice, Albert Einstein Hubo, BINA48, Han, Jules, Professor Einstein, Philip K. Dick Android, Zeno,[17] and Joey Chaos.[18] Around 2019â€“20, Hanson released "Little Sophia" as a companion that could teach children how to code, including support for Python, Blockly, and Raspberry Pi.[19]
